# Total Battle Analyzer Refactoring Plan: Phase 3 - Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of Phase 3 refactoring for the Total Battle Analyzer application. Phase 3 focuses on implementing the service layer, building upon the foundation established in Phases 1 and 2.

The refactoring is divided into five parts to make the implementation more manageable:

1. [Analysis Services](phase3-part1-analysis-services.md) - Core analysis functionality
2. [Visualization Services](phase3-part2-visualization-services.md) - Chart generation and visualization
3. [Reporting Services](phase3-part3-reporting-services.md) - Report generation and formatting
4. [Application Services](phase3-part4-application-services.md) - UI, configuration, and file operations
5. [Integration and Testing](phase3-part5-integration-testing.md) - Connecting all layers and testing

## Overview of Parts

### Part 1: Core Analysis Services

This part focuses on implementing the core analysis functionality:

- Analysis service interfaces
- Implementation of chest, player, and source analysis services
- Analysis manager for coordinating analysis operations
- Analysis utilities and helpers

[Read the detailed plan for Part 1](phase3-part1-analysis-services.md)

### Part 2: Visualization Services

This part focuses on implementing data visualization capabilities:

- Chart service interfaces
- Matplotlib-based chart implementation
- Chart configuration and styling
- Chart manager for coordinating chart generation

[Read the detailed plan for Part 2](phase3-part2-visualization-services.md)

### Part 3: Reporting Services

This part focuses on implementing report generation functionality:

- Report service interfaces
- HTML and Markdown report implementations
- Report templates and styling
- Report generators for different report types

### Part 4: Application Services

This part focuses on implementing application-level services:

- Configuration service for managing settings
- UI service for handling user interactions
- File service for file operations
- Service registry and provider for dependency management

[Read the detailed plan for Part 4](phase3-part4-application-services.md)

### Part 5: Integration and Testing

This part focuses on connecting all layers and implementing testing:

- Application integration class
- Unit and integration testing
- Mock data generation
- Test automation and coverage reporting

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation timeline for Phase 3 is as follows:

1. **Part 1: Core Analysis Services** - 1-2 weeks
2. **Part 2: Visualization Services** - 1 week
3. **Part 3: Reporting Services** - 1 week
4. **Part 4: Application Services** - 1 week
5. **Part 5: Integration and Testing** - 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 5-7 weeks

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 3 implementation:

- Ensure Phase 1 (Project Structure) is complete
- Ensure Phase 2 (Data Foundation) is complete
- Review the design of service interfaces
- Install all required dependencies:
  ```bash
  uv add pandas numpy matplotlib jinja2 markdown pyside6 pytest pytest-mock pytest-cov
  ```

## Execution Plan

To execute Phase 3 effectively:

1. Start with Part 1 (Analysis Services)
2. Move to Part 2 (Visualization Services) after completing Part 1
3. Implement Part 3 (Reporting Services) after Part 2
4. Continue with Part 4 (Application Services)
5. Finish with Part 5 (Integration and Testing)

After each part, review code quality, ensure tests pass, and update documentation.

## Feedback

Please provide feedback after completing each part:

- Are the services comprehensive for your needs?
- Are there any missing functionalities?
- Does the implementation align with the refactoring goals?
- Any improvements to consider before proceeding?

## Conclusion

Phase 3 represents a significant step in the refactoring of the Total Battle Analyzer application. By breaking it into manageable parts, we ensure a systematic approach to implementing the service layer while maintaining code quality and testability.
