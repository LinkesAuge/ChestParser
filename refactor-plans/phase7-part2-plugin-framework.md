# Phase 7 Part 2: Plugin & Extension Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive plugin and extension framework for the Total Battle Analyzer application. The framework will allow users and third-party developers to extend the application's functionality through custom plugins, adding new features without modifying the core application code.

## Detailed Documentation Sections
This overview is supplemented by three detailed section documents that provide comprehensive implementation details:

1. [Extensibility Architecture](phase7-part2-section1-extensibility-architecture.md) - Covers the core architecture for extensibility, including extension points, plugin interfaces, and the extension registry.

2. [Plugin Management System](phase7-part2-section2-plugin-management.md) - Details the lifecycle management of plugins, including installation, configuration, marketplace integration, and UI components.

3. [Security Model for Third-Party Code](phase7-part2-section3-security-model.md) - Outlines the security mechanisms to ensure third-party code runs safely, including sandboxing, permission systems, and code validation.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Extensibility Architecture
- Design and implement extension points across the application
- Create plugin interface definitions for various extension types
- Build plugin discovery mechanism
- Develop extension registry to manage active plugins

### 2. Plugin Management System
- Create plugin lifecycle management (install, enable, disable, uninstall)
- Build plugin configuration storage and retrieval
- Implement version compatibility verification
- Develop plugin marketplace for discovery and installation

### 3. Security Model for Third-Party Code
- Implement sandboxed execution environment
- Create permission-based security model
- Build code validation and security checking
- Develop runtime monitoring for plugin behavior

## Implementation Approach

The plugin framework will be implemented in three phases:

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Days 1-7)
- Design and implement the core extension architecture
- Create base plugin interfaces and extension points
- Implement plugin discovery and registry
- Establish basic integration with the application

### Phase 2: Management & UI (Days 8-14)
- Implement plugin lifecycle management
- Build plugin marketplace
- Create UI for plugin management
- Integrate with application configuration system

### Phase 3: Security & Validation (Days 15-21)
- Implement sandbox environment for plugin execution
- Create permission system and security model
- Build plugin validation and security checking
- Add runtime monitoring for plugin behavior

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyPlugin (plugin management)
- RestrictedPython (sandboxed execution)
- jsonschema (manifest validation)
- packaging (version comparison)
- PyCache (for optimized plugin loading)

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for core framework components
2. Integration tests with sample plugins
3. Security penetration tests
4. Performance impact tests
5. User acceptance testing for plugin management UI

## Success Criteria

1. Extensibility: The application can be extended with new functionality via plugins
2. Security: Third-party code executes safely without compromising the system
3. User Experience: Plugin management is intuitive and user-friendly
4. Performance: Plugin system has minimal impact on application performance
5. Demonstration: Sample plugins showcase the extensibility of the system

## Next Steps

With the detailed documentation complete for all three sections:

1. Begin implementation of the core extension system and plugin interfaces
2. Set up the plugin management and marketplace infrastructure
3. Develop the security model and sandbox environment
4. Create the plugin management UI components
5. Test with sample plugins and validate the complete system
