## Detailed Implementation

### 1. CI/CD Strategy Development

#### 1.1 CI/CD Workflow Definition

The Total Battle Analyzer application will follow a modern CI/CD workflow with the following stages:

1. **Code** - Developers work in feature branches
2. **Commit** - Changes are pushed to version control
3. **Build** - Automated build is triggered
4. **Test** - Automated tests are executed
5. **Quality** - Code quality checks are performed
6. **Package** - Application is packaged as installable
7. **Deploy (Dev)** - Automatic deployment to development
8. **Deploy (Test)** - Automatic deployment to test with approval
9. **Deploy (Prod)** - Deployment to production with approval

    A[Code] --> B[Commit]
    B --> C[Build]
    C --> D[Test]
    D --> E[Quality]
    E --> F[Package]
    F --> G[Deploy Dev]
    G --> H[Deploy Test]
    H --> I[Deploy Prod]
    
    D -- Fail --> A
    E -- Fail --> A
    C -- Fail --> A
```

#### 1.2 Quality Gates

To ensure application quality, the following quality gates will be implemented:

| Stage | Quality Gate | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Build | Successful compilation | Code must build successfully without errors |
| Test | Unit tests passing | All unit tests must pass |
| Test | Integration tests passing | All integration tests must pass |
| Test | UI tests passing | All UI tests must pass |
| Quality | No critical code quality issues | Code must meet quality standards |
| Quality | Test coverage > 80% | Code must have adequate test coverage |
| Quality | Security scan passed | No critical security vulnerabilities |
| Deploy (Test) | Manual approval | Team lead must approve test deployment |
| Deploy (Prod) | Manual approval | Product owner must approve production deployment |

#### 1.3 Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy will follow these principles:

1. **Environment Progression**: Changes flow from development to testing to production
2. **Automation**: All deployments are automated through CI/CD pipelines
3. **Consistency**: Same deployment process used for all environments
4. **Immutability**: Environments are not modified in place; new versions are deployed
5. **Observability**: All deployments are logged and monitored

#### 1.4 Rollback and Recovery

In case of deployment failures, the application will support:

1. **Automated Rollback**: Failed deployments automatically trigger rollback to previous working version
2. **Manual Rollback**: Option for manual rollback to any previous version
3. **Deployment Window**: Production deployments happen during defined maintenance windows
4. **Canary Deployments**: Optional gradual rollout for high-risk changes

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

#### 2.1 CI/CD Server

GitHub Actions will be used as the CI/CD server due to:
- Integration with the existing GitHub repository
- Serverless architecture eliminates maintenance overhead
- Strong ecosystem of pre-built actions
- Matrix build support for cross-platform testing

#### 2.2 Workflow Configuration

**Main CI Workflow** (.github/workflows/ci.yml):

```yaml
name: Total Battle Analyzer CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install uv
        uv pip install -e .[dev]
    
    - name: Lint with ruff
      run: |
        uv pip install ruff
        ruff check .
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        fail_ci_if_error: true
```

**CD Workflow** (.github/workflows/cd.yml) for deployment:

```yaml
name: Total Battle Analyzer CD

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build-packages:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install build wheel
    
    - name: Build package
      run: |
        python -m build
    
    - name: Create installer
      run: |
        # OS-specific installer creation
        if [ "${{ matrix.os }}" == "windows-latest" ]; then
          # Windows installer
          pip install pyinstaller
          pyinstaller --onefile --windowed src/app.py
        elif [ "${{ matrix.os }}" == "macos-latest" ]; then
          # macOS app bundle
          pip install py2app
          python setup.py py2app
        else
          # Linux AppImage
          pip install pynsis
          python setup.py bdist_pynsis
        fi
    
    - name: Upload artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: ${{ matrix.os }}-package
        path: |
          dist/
          build/
```

#### 2.3 Artifact Repository

For artifact storage:
- Use GitHub Packages for Python package distribution
- GitHub Releases for binary installers
- Configure GitHub API token for automated uploads

#### 2.4 Secrets and Credentials Management

The following secrets will be managed through GitHub Actions secrets:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For publishing to PyPI
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For uploading coverage reports
- `SIGNING_CERTIFICATE`: For code signing (Windows/macOS)
- `DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH key for deployment to servers

### 3. Version Control Strategy

#### 3.1 Branching Strategy

The Total Battle Analyzer will use a simplified Gitflow strategy:

```
main           ●───────●─────────────●──────● (stable releases)
               │       │             │      │
               │       │             │      │
develop        ●───●───●───●─────●───●──────● (integration branch)
                \     /   /     \     \     \
feature-1        ●───●   │       \     \     \
                         │        \     \     \
feature-2                ●─────────●     \     \
                                          \     \
feature-3                                  ●─────●
```

- **main**: Stable production code only
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/\***: Individual feature branches
- **release/\***: Release candidate branches
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes for production

#### 3.2 Branch Protection Rules

For `main` branch:
- Require pull request approvals (2 reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require linear history
- Do not allow force pushes
- Do not allow deletion

For `develop` branch:
- Require pull request approvals (1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow force pushes by administrators

#### 3.3 Automated Versioning

Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) will be used:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features, backwards-compatible
- PATCH: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

Version bumping will be automated using:

```bash
# In .github/workflows/release.yml
- name: Bump version
  id: bump_version
  uses: phips28/gh-action-bump-version@master
  with:
    tag-prefix: 'v'
    minor-wording: 'feat,feature'
    major-wording: 'BREAKING,MAJOR'
    patch-wording: 'fix,bugfix,patch'
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

#### 4.1 Environment Definitions

| Environment | Purpose | Access | Deployment Frequency |
|-------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Development | For developers during active development | Developers only | Continuous (every commit) |
| Testing | For QA and feature validation | Team members | On feature completion |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | Stakeholders | Before planned releases |
| Production | End-user environment | Public users | Scheduled releases |

#### 4.2 Environment Configuration Management

Environment-specific configuration will be managed through:

1. Configuration files per environment
2. Environment variables for sensitive information
3. Feature flags for controlled rollout

Configuration example in `config.py`:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from enum import Enum

class Environment(Enum):
    DEVELOPMENT = "development"
    TESTING = "testing"
    STAGING = "staging"
    PRODUCTION = "production"

# Determine current environment
ENVIRONMENT = Environment(os.getenv("APP_ENVIRONMENT", "development"))

# Base configuration
BASE_CONFIG = {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "data_dir": Path("data"),
    "export_dir": Path("exports"),
    "max_file_size_mb": 100,
    "enable_analytics": False,
}

# Environment-specific overrides
ENV_CONFIGS = {
    Environment.DEVELOPMENT: {
        "log_level": "DEBUG",
        "enable_debug_tools": True,
    },
    Environment.TESTING: {
        "log_level": "DEBUG",
        "test_data_dir": Path("test_data"),
    },
    Environment.STAGING: {
        "enable_analytics": True,
    },
    Environment.PRODUCTION: {
        "log_level": "WARNING",
        "enable_analytics": True,
        "max_file_size_mb": 500,
    }
}

# Merge configurations
CONFIG = {**BASE_CONFIG, **ENV_CONFIGS.get(ENVIRONMENT, {})}
```
