# Total Battle Analyzer - Application Report

## Overview
The Total Battle Analyzer is a desktop application built with PySide6 that allows users to import, view, analyze, and visualize data from the Total Battle game. It provides a user-friendly GUI with multiple tabs for different functionality. The application features a dark blue and gold color theme inspired by the Total Battle game UI.

## Refactoring Plans
The application is currently undergoing a comprehensive refactoring effort, organized into multiple phases:

### Phase 4 - User Interface Implementation
Phase 4 focuses on implementing a modern, modular, and maintainable user interface for the Total Battle Analyzer. The refactoring is divided into five parts:

1. **UI Foundation** - Setting up the core architecture, main window, navigation system, and theme manager.

2. **UI Components** - Implementing reusable UI components:
   - **Data Tables**: Advanced data display with filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - **Charts and Visualizations**: Flexible chart widgets with multiple types (Bar, Pie, Line, etc.)
   - **Input Forms**: Modular form system with validation and various field types
   - **Custom Dialogs**: Reusable dialog windows for settings, confirmations, and data import/export
   - **Notification System**: Toast notifications and status bar messages

3. **Application Screens** - Creating application-specific screens:
   - **Import Screen**: Data importing and preview functionality
   - **Raw Data Screen**: Viewing and filtering raw data
   - **Analysis Screen**: Data analysis with multiple views and filtering
   - Each screen implemented as a separate module with consistent architecture
   - Screens connected through a central screen manager for navigation

4. **Charts and Visualization Screen** - Implementing advanced visualization capabilities:
   - Chart control panel with comprehensive configuration options
   - Chart display area using Matplotlib integration
   - Multiple chart types (Bar, Horizontal Bar, Pie, Line, Area, Scatter)
   - Chart customization including titles, colors, and styling
   - Chart export in multiple formats (PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG)

5. **Report Generation Screen** - Creating comprehensive reporting functionality:
   - Report type selection (Comprehensive, Summary, Focused)
   - Content customization options
   - Format selection (HTML, PDF, Markdown)
   - Report preview and export capabilities
   - Template-based report generation

The refactoring follows a layered approach with foundation, components, screens, and integration layers. This architecture separates UI logic from business logic, improves code modularity, and enhances user experience while maintaining the Total Battle-inspired dark blue and gold theme.

### Phase 5 - Testing and Quality Assurance
