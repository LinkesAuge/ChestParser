# German Umlaut Solution Implementation

## Requirements
Based on the provided german-umlaut-solution.md, we need to implement a comprehensive solution for handling German umlauts and encoding issues in our CSV processing.

## Todo List

### 1. Dependencies Installation
- [x] Install required packages: ftfy, charset-normalizer, unidecode, textacy (optional)
- [x] Update pyproject.toml with new dependencies

### 2. DataProcessor Enhancement
- [x] Create a new function `fix_encoding` using ftfy
- [x] Implement the comprehensive `read_csv_with_encoding_fix` function
- [x] Enhance `load_csv` method to use the new encoding detection and fixing approach
- [x] Add functions for Unicode normalization
- [x] Implement pattern-based corrections for common mojibake patterns
- [x] Add `fix_dataframe_text` function for advanced text processing
- [x] Create a proper writing function that preserves encodings: `write_csv_with_umlauts`

### 3. Testing and Verification
- [x] Test the solution with known problematic CSV files
- [x] Verify that umlauts are correctly preserved
- [x] Check that mojibake is properly fixed
- [x] Test both reading and writing functions

### 4. Integration
- [x] Ensure that MainWindow properly uses the enhanced DataProcessor
- [x] Update file export functionality to use `write_csv_with_umlauts`
- [x] Ensure proper error handling for encoding issues

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Document the changes in app_report.mdc
- [x] Update memory.mdc with implementation details

### 6. Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix CSV loading issue with German umlauts ("Failed to load CSV" error)
- [x] Improve encoding detection for European languages
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and debugging

# Chart Tab Enhancement

## Requirements
We need to improve the Charts tab by addressing redundancy in the "data to show" and "sort by" options, and implementing a more logical selection mechanism.

## Todo List

### 1. Two-Step Data Selection Process
- [x] Replace old "Data to Show" dropdown with two logical selections
- [x] Add "Group By" dropdown for dimension selection (PLAYER, CHEST, SOURCE, DATE)
- [x] Add "Measure" dropdown for metric selection (TOTAL_SCORE, CHEST_COUNT, AVG_SCORE, etc.)
- [x] Create dynamic UI that updates available measures based on selected dimension
- [x] Implement dynamic sort options that change based on selected dimension

### 2. Code Refactoring
- [x] Update setup_charts_tab method to implement the new UI
- [x] Create new helper methods update_available_measures and update_sort_options
- [x] Modify update_chart_data_category to work with the Group By selection
- [x] Update update_chart_data_column to work with the Measure selection
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing charts code

### 3. Chart Update Logic
- [x] Modify update_chart method to use the new two-step selection
- [x] Update chart title formatting to reflect Group By and Measure
- [x] Ensure proper data selection based on dimension and measure
- [x] Fix sorting functionality to work with the new structure

### 4. Export Functionality
- [x] Update save_chart method to work with the new selection process
- [x] Ensure both image export and data export functions properly
- [x] Fix CSV/Excel export to use the proper columns based on selections

### 5. Testing and Documentation
- [x] Document changes in app_report.mdc
- [x] Update memory.mdc with implementation details

## Progress
*2024-07-07: Completed Chart Tab Enhancement:*
- Implemented two-step data selection with Group By and Measure dropdowns
- Created dynamic measure options that change based on selected dimension
- Updated chart update logic to use the new selection process
- Fixed chart export functionality to work with the new structure
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Improved UX by eliminating redundancy in chart data selection
- Enhanced chart title to reflect the selected dimension and measure

# Consistent Pathlib Implementation

## Requirements
We need to consistently use the pathlib module throughout the codebase instead of os.path for better path handling.

## Todo List

### 1. Main.py Updates
- [x] Update create_directories() function to use only Path objects
- [x] Replace os.path.join and os.path.exists with Path methods
- [x] Update the icon_path handling to use Path

### 2. ConfigManager Updates
- [x] Update the ConfigManager class to use Path for directory management
- [x] Modify load_config() to use Path for file operations
- [x] Update all path-related methods to use Path objects

### 3. DataProcessor Updates
- [x] Refactor read_csv_with_encoding_fix() to use Path for file operations
- [x] Update file_exists checks to use Path.exists()
- [x] Modify file size checks to use Path.stat().st_size

### 4. Utils.py Updates
- [x] Update the ConfigManager class to use Path for directory operations
- [x] Modify path handling functions to use Path objects

### 5. MainWindow Updates
- [ ] Refactor path handling in load_csv_file() and related methods
- [ ] Update chart export functionality to use Path
- [ ] Update file dialog operations to work with Path objects

### 6. Other Modules
- [ ] Ensure consistent Path usage in ImportArea
- [ ] Update path operations in any other modules

### 7. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test importing CSV files
- [ ] Verify exporting works properly
- [ ] Ensure directory creation works correctly

## Progress
*2024-07-06: Identified areas for pathlib conversion:*
- Found multiple instances of os.path.join and os.path.exists in main.py
- Discovered mixed usage of os.path and pathlib in ConfigManager
- Located file operations in DataProcessor that need conversion
- Identified multiple path operations in MainWindow class

*2024-07-06: Completed updates to main files:*
- Updated main.py to use Path objects consistently
- Converted all path operations in ConfigManager to use Path
- Updated ConfigManager in utils.py to use Path objects
- Refactored DataProcessor to use Path for file operations
- Changed file existence checks to use Path.exists()
- Modified file size checks to use Path.stat().st_size
- Consistently handle both str and Path file paths in all methods

*Key reminders:*
- Replace os.path.join(a, b) with Path(a) / b
- Replace os.path.exists(path) with Path(path).exists()
- Replace os.path.abspath(path) with Path(path).absolute()
- Replace os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True) with Path(path).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
- Replace os.path.dirname(path) with Path(path).parent
- Replace os.getcwd() with Path.cwd()
- Replace os.path.expanduser("~") with Path.home()
