### 2024-07-17: Complete Chart System Rewrite

- **Task**: Fix issues with Charts tab not displaying data after the chart system rewrite
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**:
  - Identified multiple issues preventing charts from being displayed after the recent comprehensive chart system rewrite:
    - Duplicate implementations of the `update_available_measures` method in the codebase
    - The method at the end of the file (just a stub with a `pass` statement) was overriding the actual implementation
    - Data category format mismatch between methods: the category format in `_get_chart_data` and `_get_category_column` methods was different from the format expected in the `update_available_measures` method
  
  - Implemented fixes:
    - Removed the duplicate stub implementation of `update_available_measures` at the end of the file
    - Updated the `_get_chart_data` and `_get_category_column` methods to use the standardized category format ("PLAYER", "CHEST", "SOURCE", "DATE")
    - Added improved error handling in both methods to provide better debug information
    - Enhanced docstrings for better clarity and future consistency
    - Added diagnostic messages to help trace data loading issues
  
  - Results:
    - The measure dropdown is now properly populated based on the selected data category
    - Charts are correctly displayed when data is available and measures are selected
    - All chart customization options (type, sort, limit, etc.) function as designed
    - Error handling is more robust with clear messages when no data is available
    - The complete chart system now works correctly while maintaining the enhancements from the rewrite

## Dependencies
- PySide6: 6.8.2.1
- matplotlib: 3.10.1
- pandas: 2.2.3
- numpy: 1.26.4
- ftfy: 6.1.3 (new)
- charset-normalizer: 3.3.2 (new)
- unidecode: 1.3.7 (new)

## Notes
- The application uses a dark blue and gold theme inspired by the Total Battle game
- Has multiple tabs: Import, Raw Data, Analysis, Charts, and Report
- CSV files may contain special characters requiring different encodings (like Windows-1252 or Latin-1)
- Proper pandas DataFrame handling requires checking `is None` or `.empty` rather than direct boolean evaluation
- PySide6 6.8.2.1 uses updated filtering API methods compared to older versions
- We now use a unified launcher (run.py) instead of multiple fix files
- All fixes have been integrated directly into the main file for simpler maintenance
- Application now has improved error handling with detailed tracebacks and user-friendly error dialogs
- The theme application has been enhanced to ensure consistent styling throughout the application
- Windows visibility issues have been addressed with proper window activation
- The application now uses UV with pyproject.toml for dependency management instead of pip with requirements.txt
  - IMPORTANT: Always use `uv add package_name` to add new dependencies to the project
  - For installing the project in development mode, use `uv pip install -e .`
  - Do NOT use `pip` for package management in this project
- The new Report tab provides comprehensive analysis with HTML/PDF export capabilities
- Chart functionality now includes 3D visualizations with bubble charts showing efficiency metrics
- Efficiency calculations (points per chest) provide additional insights into player performance
- Filter areas now use full vertical space for better usability when selecting values
- Charts tab has enhanced customization options and better space utilization
- The application now uses pathlib consistently for file and directory operations, which improves cross-platform compatibility

    - mainwindow.py - Contains the MainWindow class and UI logic
    - dataprocessor.py - Contains the DataProcessor class for data processing and analysis
    - models.py - Contains custom models for tables and data
    - ui/ - UI-related components
    - style/ - Styling and theme components
  - utils/
    - configuration.py - Configuration management
    - helpers.py - Helper functions
  - total-battle-analyzer.py - Main application entry point
- data/ - Contains sample data files
- docs/ - Documentation
  - app_report.mdc - Comprehensive report about the application
  - memory.mdc - This file
  - bugfixing.mdc - Bug tracking and fixes
- tests/ - Test scripts and data

## Previous Tasks
- Created test scripts to verify analysis functionality
- Added debug logging to help diagnose and fix issues
- Researched how the DataProcessor.analyze_data method works
- Implemented various test scripts to trace data flow

## Important Components
- MainWindow - Main application window with UI setup and event handling
- DataProcessor - Handles loading, processing, and analyzing data
- CustomTableModel - Custom model for displaying tabular data
- MplCanvas - Matplotlib integration for chart creation

## Known Issues
- ✅ Analysis tab showing raw data instead of processed analysis (FIXED)

## Notes
- The application follows a structure where the MainWindow contains UI logic and delegates data processing to DataProcessor
- The DataProcessor.analyze_data method returns a dictionary of DataFrames with various analysis types
- The duplicate method was causing the app to display raw data instead of processed data
- Debug logging was added to trace the data flow in the update_analysis_view method

## Recent Tasks (2024-03-12)

### Fixed Chart Coloring Issue
- Problem: Charts in the Charts tab were not being colored properly. All bars/segments were using the same color.
- Solution: Updated the `update_chart` method in `mainwindow.py` to use multiple colors from the TABLEAU_COLORS palette.
- Also enhanced the `MplCanvas` class to provide better style application methods and color palette access.

### Fixed Double File Dialog Issue
- Problem: When selecting a CSV file to import, a second file dialog would appear after the first one was closed.
- Root Cause: Multiple signal connections were triggering file dialogs, and there was no mechanism to prevent rapid successive calls.
- Solution: 
  1. Added a flag `_file_dialog_active`

## 2024-07-17: Fixed Player Grouping in Charts to Show Source Breakdown

### Task
Fix the issue where player grouping in charts doesn't show source breakdown (Guild, Battle, Event, etc.)

### Status
Completed

### Details
- Identified that the chart system was using `player_totals` DataFrame for PLAYER data category, which only contains PLAYER, SCORE, and CHEST_COUNT columns
- Modified the `_get_chart_data` method to use `player_overview` DataFrame instead, which contains additional source columns (Guild, Battle, Event, etc.)
- Updated the `update_available_measures` method to include source columns from `player_overview` in the measures dropdown
- Added fallback to `player_totals` if `player_overview` is not available for backward compatibility
- Added extensive debug output to help diagnose similar issues in the future
- Created a debug script (`debug_chart_data.py`) to test and verify the fix
- The chart system now properly shows all source columns as available measures when PLAYER is selected
- Users can now create charts showing Guild, Battle, Event, and other source scores for each player
- Source columns are dynamically detected from the data, so new source types will automatically appear in the measures dropdown

## 2024-07-17: Fixed Chart Export and Save Chart Functionality

### Task
Fix issues with chart export showing double popups, save chart button not working, and limited measure options for CHEST category

### Status
Completed

### Details
- Identified and fixed multiple issues with the chart export and save functionality:
  1. Removed duplicate signal connections in the setup_charts_tab method that were causing multiple popups
  2. Updated the update_available_measures method to add CHEST_COUNT for all data categories (CHEST, SOURCE, DATE)
  3. Enhanced the export_chart_data method to use player_overview data when PLAYER is selected
  4. Added debug print statements to both methods to help diagnose issues
  5. Ensured the save_chart method works correctly for all image formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG)
  6. Made the export_chart_data method show only one success popup
  7. Added status bar updates for better user feedback
- The chart system now provides more comprehensive measure options for all data categories
- Chart data export now includes source breakdown columns when exporting player data
- All chart export and save functionality works correctly with proper error handling

## 2024-07-18: Fixed "No file loaded" Text Not Updating in Import Tab

### Task: Fix the "No file loaded" text not updating in the import tab when a file is loaded
**Status**: Completed

### Details
- **Problem**: The `file_label` at the top of the import tab showing "No file loaded" wasn't being updated after a CSV file was successfully loaded, even though the ImportArea widget below it correctly showed the selected file name.
- **Investigation**:
  - Located where the `file_label` is created in the `setup_import_tab` method in `mainwindow.py`
  - Found that while the ImportArea was correctly updating its own `file_info` label via the `fileSelected` signal, the MainWindow's `file_label` wasn't being updated
  - The issue was that `load_csv_file` method didn't update the `file_label` after successfully loading a file
- **Fix**:
  - Added code to the `load_csv_file` method to update the `file_label` after a file is successfully loaded:
    ```python
    # Update file label in the import tab
    if hasattr(self, 'file_label'):
        self.file_label.setText(f"File loaded: {file_path.name}")
        if self.debug:
            print(f"Updated file_label with: {file_path.name}")
    ```
  - Used `hasattr` check to ensure backward compatibility in case the UI structure changes
  - Added debug output to help track the update
- **Results**:
  - The "No file loaded" text now properly changes to "File loaded: [filename]" when a file is loaded
  - The update is synchronized with the already-working file info display in the ImportArea
  - The fix is properly documented in the `bugfixing.mdc` file

## 2024-07-18: Fixed Duplicate Chart Updates and Redundant Data Loading in Charts Tab

### Task: Fix redundant data loading and multiple chart updates when changing options in the Charts tab
**Status**: Completed

### Details
- **Problem**: When changing options in the Charts tab, the application was triggering multiple redundant chart updates (up to 3 for a single change) and reloading data each time
- **Investigation**:
  - Analyzed the debug output showing multiple identical calls to `update_chart` and `_get_chart_data` for a single user action
  - Discovered multiple issues contributing to the problem:
    1. Multiple signal connections from the same UI control
    2. Redundant `update_chart` calls in helper methods
    3. No caching of data between updates
    4. Signal propagation during dropdown population causing cascade updates
    5. No debounce mechanism to prevent rapid updates
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple improvements:
  
  1. **Added debounce mechanism** to `update_chart`:
    ```python
    current_time = time.time()
    if hasattr(self, '_last_chart_update_time') and (current_time - self._last_chart_update_time < 0.2):
        if self.debug:
            print(f"Skipping rapid chart update request")
        return
    self._last_chart_update_time = current_time
    ```
  
  2. **Added signal blocking** to `update_available_measures` and `update_sort_options`:
    ```python
    was_blocked = self.chart_data_column.signalsBlocked()
    self.chart_data_column.blockSignals(True)
    try:
        # Populate dropdown
    finally:
        self.chart_data_column.blockSignals(was_blocked)
    ```
  
  3. **Preserved dropdown selections** during updates to prevent unnecessary changes
  
  4. **Implemented data caching** in `_get_chart_data`:
    ```python
    if hasattr(self, '_chart_data_cache') and self._chart_data_cache.get('category') == data_category:
        return self._chart_data_cache.get('data')
    ```
  
  5. **Enhanced `_update_chart_options** to block signals during updates:
    ```python
    def _update_chart_options(self):
        # Block signals during updates
        if hasattr(self, 'chart_data_column'):
            self.chart_data_column.blockSignals(True)
        # ...update options...
        # Unblock signals and update chart once
    ```
  
- **Results**:
  - Chart is now updated only once per user action
  - Data is loaded only when necessary, with subsequent updates using cached data
  - Debug output shows cleaner logs with no duplicate "update_chart called" messages
  - UI responds more quickly with significantly reduced processing
  - All chart functionality continues to work correctly

## 2024-07-18: Fixed AttributeError in Charts Tab Column Check

### Task: Fix AttributeError when adding columns to the CHEST category dropdown
**Status**: Completed

### Details
- **Problem**: An error appeared when changing data categories in the Charts tab: `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'text'`
- **Investigation**:
  - Error was triggered in the `update_available_measures` method when trying to check if player columns were already in the dropdown
  - The issue was in this line: 
    ```python
    if col not in [item.text() for item in [self.chart_data_column.itemText(i) for i in range(self.chart_data_column.count())]]:
    ```
  - The code incorrectly assumed `self.chart_data_column.itemText(i)` returns objects with a `text()` method
  - In reality, `itemText(i)` already returns strings, which don't have a `text()` method
- **Fix**:
  - Simplified the column check with clearer code:
    ```python
    # Get existing items as strings
    existing_items = [self.chart_data_column.itemText(i) for i in range(self.chart_data_column.count())]
    
    # Check if the column is already in the dropdown
    if col not in existing_items:
        self.chart_data_column.addItem(col)
    ```
  - This approach correctly handles the strings returned by `itemText()` without trying to call any methods on them
- **Results**:
  - The Charts tab now works correctly when switching between data categories
  - Player columns are properly added to the CHEST category measures without errors
  - The application no longer crashes with this AttributeError
  - All the dropdown functionality continues to work properly with this fix
